# euler

My attempts at solving [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
problems. I'm hoping that these math-focused problems will help me to think
like a mathematician in programming and problem solving.

All solutions are written in [guile scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/),
because scheme has good support for numerical types/operations, and all math
problems demand elegant solutions :D
