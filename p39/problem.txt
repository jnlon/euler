If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

-- Notes --

- Right angled triangle means a^2 + b^2 = c^2
- We need to find every combination of (a,b,c) such that the pythagorean
  theorem is satisfied

- We could iterate for every a < p, then for every b < p, calculate c, then
  return a list of those who satisfy pythagorean theorem

- We could generate a list of pairs (a, b), permutation from 0..p, but that
  would be memory inefficient...

- for-every-a
  - for-every-b
  ...
